/**
 * Manages a Management Lock which is scoped to a Subscription, Resource Group or Resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Subscription Level Lock)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const current = azure.core.getSubscription({});
 * const subscription_level = new azure.management.Lock("subscription-level", {
 *     scope: current.then(current => current.id),
 *     lockLevel: "CanNotDelete",
 *     notes: "Items can't be deleted in this subscription!",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ##Â Example Usage (Resource Group Level Lock)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const example = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("example", {location: "West Europe"});
 * const resource_group_level = new azure.management.Lock("resource-group-level", {
 *     scope: example.id,
 *     lockLevel: "ReadOnly",
 *     notes: "This Resource Group is Read-Only",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Resource Level Lock)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azure from "@pulumi/azure";
 *
 * const exampleResourceGroup = new azure.core.ResourceGroup("exampleResourceGroup", {location: "West Europe"});
 * const examplePublicIp = new azure.network.PublicIp("examplePublicIp", {
 *     location: exampleResourceGroup.location,
 *     resourceGroupName: exampleResourceGroup.name,
 *     allocationMethod: "Static",
 *     idleTimeoutInMinutes: 30,
 * });
 * const public_ip = new azure.management.Lock("public-ip", {
 *     scope: examplePublicIp.id,
 *     lockLevel: "CanNotDelete",
 *     notes: "Locked because it's needed by a third-party",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Management Locks can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import azure:management/lock:Lock lock1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/locks/lock1
 * ```

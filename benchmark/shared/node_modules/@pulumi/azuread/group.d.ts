/**
 * Manages a group within Azure Active Directory.
 *
 * ## API Permissions
 *
 * The following API permissions are required in order to use this resource.
 *
 * When authenticated with a service principal, this resource requires one of the following application roles: `Group.ReadWrite.All` or `Directory.ReadWrite.All`
 *
 * If using the `assignableToRole` property, this resource additionally requires one of the following application roles: `RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory` or `Directory.ReadWrite.All`
 *
 * If specifying owners for a group, which are user principals, this resource additionally requires one of the following application roles: `User.Read.All`, `User.ReadWrite.All`, `Directory.Read.All` or `Directory.ReadWrite.All`
 *
 * When authenticated with a user principal, this resource requires one of the following directory roles: `Groups Administrator`, `User Administrator` or `Global Administrator`
 *
 * The `externalSendersAllowed`, `autoSubscribeNewMembers`, `hideFromAddressLists` and `hideFromOutlookClients` properties can only be configured when authenticating as a user and cannot be configured when authenticating as a service principal. Additionally, the user being used for authentication must be a Member of the tenant where the group is being managed and _not_ a Guest. This is a known API issue; please see the [Microsoft Graph Known Issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues#groups) official documentation.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * *Basic example*
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const current = azuread.getClientConfig({});
 * const example = new azuread.Group("example", {
 *     displayName: "example",
 *     owners: [current.then(current => current.objectId)],
 *     securityEnabled: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * *Microsoft 365 group*
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const current = azuread.getClientConfig({});
 * const groupOwner = new azuread.User("groupOwner", {
 *     userPrincipalName: "example-group-owner@hashicorp.com",
 *     displayName: "Group Owner",
 *     mailNickname: "example-group-owner",
 *     password: "SecretP@sswd99!",
 * });
 * const example = new azuread.Group("example", {
 *     displayName: "example",
 *     mailEnabled: true,
 *     mailNickname: "ExampleGroup",
 *     securityEnabled: true,
 *     types: ["Unified"],
 *     owners: [
 *         current.then(current => current.objectId),
 *         groupOwner.objectId,
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * *Group with members*
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const current = azuread.getClientConfig({});
 * const exampleUser = new azuread.User("exampleUser", {
 *     displayName: "J Doe",
 *     owners: [current.then(current => current.objectId)],
 *     password: "notSecure123",
 *     userPrincipalName: "jdoe@hashicorp.com",
 * });
 * const exampleGroup = new azuread.Group("exampleGroup", {
 *     displayName: "MyGroup",
 *     owners: [current.then(current => current.objectId)],
 *     securityEnabled: true,
 *     members: [exampleUser.objectId],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * *Group with dynamic membership*
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const current = azuread.getClientConfig({});
 * const example = new azuread.Group("example", {
 *     displayName: "MyGroup",
 *     owners: [current.then(current => current.objectId)],
 *     securityEnabled: true,
 *     types: ["DynamicMembership"],
 *     dynamicMembership: {
 *         enabled: true,
 *         rule: "user.department -eq \"Sales\"",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Groups can be imported using their object ID, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import azuread:index/group:Group my_group 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
 * ```
